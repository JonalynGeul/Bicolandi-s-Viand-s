						<p>The Bicol Express or "sinilihan" is a local filipino cuisine stewed in coconut milk (locally known as "gata"), a lot of chilies and pork slices. 
							The dish  was actually popularized, prepared and sold in Malate, Manila and we can consider that it is a myth that the
							 Bicol Express originated in the province of Bicol.
						  
							Having an almost perfect cone shape, Bicol is known for its volcano Mt. Mayon. 
							Because of this, Bicol has been one of the best tourist spots in the country,
							helping to promote tourism in the Philippines. But aside from that, what is
						    another word that comes to mind when hearing the word Bicol? Mt. Mayon
							is not the only reason why Bicol is famous, 
							but also for becauxse of its culinary specialty, Bicol Express.</p>
