				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>Every province in the Philippines may already have its own version of the dish, but we all agree
					that once you've tasted the authentic one from Bicol, you won't be looking at any other Bicol
				    Express outside the region. Bicol is also known for its distinct cuisine, which mostly features
					the creamy coconut milk or gata, red chili peppers, and their other major crops. <br>

                     In Bicol, we believe that Bicolandias Viand's are what most people are always looking for, because 
					 of its deliciousness, and spicy foods. Bicolandias Viand's specially Bicol Express, Laing, Kinunot, 
					 Sinantol, Tilmok, and Kandinga is very popular in Bicol, because of its delicious taste. Bicolandias foods 
					 is popular for their spiceness.
